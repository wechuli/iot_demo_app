## What is ThingSpace?

ThingSpace is Verizon's Internet of Things (IoT) platform that simplifies the prototyping and development of IoT applications. It enables your devices to send data securely over Verizon cellular network so you can focus on building your applications.

## What can I develop with ThingSpace

ThingSpace is an open development environment that allows and encourages independent developers and enterprise customers and everyone in between to create innovative IoT applications. Designed to be technology agnostic, the ThingSpace platform incorporates a wide range of devices, services, and protocols to give you the tools you need to develop anything your imagination conceives.

## ThingSpace SDK

The ThingSpace SDK is a client software that resides within each device, chipset, module or microcontroller that enables communication with the ThingSpace platform. To accelerate speed to market, ThingSpace has partnered with many of the leading chipset providers to pre-integrate the ThingSpace SDK on device.

ThingSpace offers a single point of entry for development, connectivity, testing and automation tools for IoT.
