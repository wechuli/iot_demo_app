## Create a template from Custom File

You can also create your own application templates from existing IoT Central applications. You can then use your own application templates when you create new applications.

When you create an application template, it includes the following items from your existing application:

- The default application dashboard, including the dashboard layout and all the tiles you've defined.
- Device templates, including measurements, settings, properties, commands, and dashboard.
- Rules. All rule definitions are included. However actions, except for email actions, aren't included.
- Device sets, including their conditions and dashboards.

When you create an application template, it doesn't include the following items:

- Devices
- Users
- Job definitions
- Continuous data export definitions
